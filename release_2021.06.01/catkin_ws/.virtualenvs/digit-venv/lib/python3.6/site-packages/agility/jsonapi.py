        """Installs a handler function for messages from the robot.

        This is a low-level method, :meth:`monitor` should be used instead in
        most cases.

        The handler can either be a normal function or a coroutine (async def).
        The provided handler must take the :class:`.Message` to handle as the
        only argument. It should return False or None if the message should be
        passed to handlers further down in the hierarchy or True if the message
        was completely handled and should not be processed further.

        Each handler has a particular key that identifies which messages it
        gets called for and when it gets called in the hierarchy. The key types
        and hierarchy of handlers is as follows:

            1. All: api.handle('all', handler)
            2. Reference number: api.handle(123, handler)
            3. Message type: api.handle('message-type', handler)
            4. Default: api.handle('default', handler)

        Multiple handlers can be installed at once for a given key. In this
        case, all of the handlers for the same key are called for a given
        message, but the relative ordering is undefined. When any of multiple
        handlers for the same key returns True, the message is not passed to
        the next set of handlers in the hierarchy, but it is always passed to
        all of the handlers for the same key.

        Returns an integer that can be passed to :meth:`remove_handler` to
        remove the installed handler.

        Args:
            key: int for reference number handlers, the message type name for
                message type handlers, or the values 'all' or 'default'
            handler: Callable handler

        Returns:
            A handler number that can be used to remove the handler later. This
            will be unique for each call of handle even if the same handler
