"""The agility.messages module contains the Message class used to represent
messages received from the robot, as well as a collection of message creation
helpers.

When using the message creation helpers, we recommend using a shortened import
alias for them::

    import agility.messages as msgs
    msg = msgs.ActionGoto(target=msgs.Pose(xy=[10, 0]))

The message creation helpers are not needed to send messages using
:class:`.JsonApi`. All methods accept equivalent JSON-like objects as well, and
if no fields need to be specified, they will also accept just the message type
as a string::

    # All of the following are equivalent
    await api.send(msgs.ActionStand())
    await api.send(["action-stand", {}])
    await api.send("action-stand")

    # Equivalent ways of specifying a message with explicit field values
    await api.send(msgs.ActionStand(base_pose=msgs.Pose(xyz=[0, 0, 1])))
    await api.send(["action-stand", {"base-pose": {"xyz": [0, 0, 1]}}])
    await api.send(msgs.ActionStand(base_pose={"xyz": [0, 0, 1]}))

If your code editor supports autocompletion and it is correctly configured, the
message creation helpers can help write code more quickly. For example, typing
"msgs.Action" should bring up a tab-complete list of action messages, and when
a specific action is selected your editor may also list the message fields
available as keyword arguments.

When using an older version of this library with a newer version of the
simulator, any newly added message types will not have corresponding message
creation helpers. In this case, you can always just specify the message in
JSON-like format.

The message creation helpers themselves are not listed in this documentation.
Instead, consult the main JSON API documentation for descriptions of each
message. The message helpers and their fields are named after the JSON messages
as listed in the main API documentation, but message names are converted to
CamelCase and fields are converted to use underscores_as_separators instead of
dashes, in accordance with Python's syntax and standard style. Structs and
enums also have helpers in the agility.messages module.
